*Abloom (Possibly)* illustrates the disciplining of noise, where a stochastic motion is undermined, interrupted, and at times, overtaken by order and harmony. Gestures morph into patterns through repetition or paraphrase. Patterns collapse, spawn new gestures, or persist, but noise returns every so often. Existing patterns are reinforced by the live electronics, and computer-controlled order is forced upon chaos. Within the contradictions between order and chaos and between elegance and grotesque, the possibility of transformation grows.
