I broke all three springs off from the reverb tank a while ago. So now I play the spring reverb without the springs.

For a performance with a springful spring reverb, see [Nothing New Trio live at 2640 Space (5/12/24)]({{ site.baseurl }}/sounds/nothing-new-trio-live-at-2640-space-5-12-24).

mod f is an electronic improvising duo of Alexander Wu and Maxwell Gong.
