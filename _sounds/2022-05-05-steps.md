*Steps* is a study of the minimum number of steps required to transition from one affect to another. The contrast between the alternated calm and agitated sections is explicit but meant to be experienced as one holistic state of mind. As inseparable and interdependent as the moods are, they are also unstable, constantly collapsing into one another.
