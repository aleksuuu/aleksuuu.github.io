The memory of a memory—which might or might not be fictitious itself—forms the basis for this piece. The music was conceived as an imaginary, twisted jazz piano trio—with the trumpet occasionally striving to produce a timbre resembling a percussive double bass—and over time, this made-up band became embedded in my memory, though buried under layers of fabrication. This was therefore my attempt to recreate something that had never existed.
