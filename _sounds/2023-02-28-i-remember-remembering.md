The memory of a memory—which might or might not be !ctitious itself— forms the basis for this piece. The music was conceived as an imaginary, twisted jazz piano trio—with the trumpet occasionally striving to produce a timbre resembling a percussive double bass—and over time, this made-up band became embedded in my memory, though buried under layers of fabrication. This was therefore my attempt to re-create something that had never existed.
