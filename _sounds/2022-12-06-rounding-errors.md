*Rounding Errors* explores different forms of quantization as well as seemingly failed attempts at quantization. Inspired by breakbeat music and in particular, the often sampled “Amen break” by The Winstons, this piece reimagines acoustic percussion instruments as a physical embodiment of samplers, drum machines, and Euclidean rhythm generators. Through the expansion and contraction of time, stability is constantly disrupted and rebuilt.
