_(intro)introintrointrointrointr_ is a poor transcription of five introductions to pieces of distinct characters that are somehow connected (by timbral, melodic, or rhythmic motives). The five introductions lead nowhere except to one another, forming a rhizome-like structure; contradictorily, a beginning and an end are derived from this structure, and a form is imposed upon the loosely related materials. With this structure, I want to capture the ephemeral excitement of starting anew along with the inexorable dread of a seemingly directionless journey.

The five pieces are “Evidence” by Thelonious Monk, “Daily Routine” by Animal Collective, _Jonchaies_ by Iannis Xenakis, “One Minute” by Ryoji Ikeda, and “Apistat Commander” by Xiu Xiu.
