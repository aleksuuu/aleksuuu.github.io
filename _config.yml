# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Alexander Wu is a composer, pianist, electronic producer, improviser, and programmer based in Boston. 
  His music explores the relationships that exist within sound, between sound and society, 
  and among those who make sound. He has composed in and between various styles, 
  including contemporary classical, jazz, and electronic music. 
  His work is often inspired by noise, the physicality of sound, and the intervening space created through the translation of a medium, language, or culture.
