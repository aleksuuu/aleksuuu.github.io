# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Alexander Wu
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
Alexander Wu is a composer, pianist, electronic producer, improviser, and programmer based in Baltimore, MD. His music is a constant negotiation between what is possible or present and what is not. In physical, logical, and perceptual extremities, he reconstructs memories, and with these sonic alterations, he captures emotional subtleties that are difficult to access through other mediums. After graduating _summa cum laude_ from Berklee College of Music with a bachelor’s degree in Composition and Electronic Production and Design in 2023, Alexander is currently pursuing a master’s degree in Composition at the Peabody Institute, studying with Dr. Sky Macklay.
