# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Alexander Wu
description: >- # ignore new lines
  Alexander Wu is a composer, improviser, pianist, electronic producer, and programmer based in Baltimore, MD. He is interested in far-fetched logic, misplaced memories, profaned tools, and sometimes disappointing sounds. He likes to mechanize the body and embody the machine, just as much as he likes to mechanize the machine and embody the body. Above all, however, he likes when both refuse to be either.

  吴缺，作曲人，也演奏即兴音乐、弹钢琴、制作电子音乐、编程。住在美国巴尔的摩。他的兴趣包括：牵强的逻辑、误置的记忆、被亵渎的工具、有时令人失望的声音。他喜欢让身体成为机器、让机器成为身体；他也同样喜欢让机器做机器、让身体做身体。但他尤其热爱那些身体和机器都拒绝成为身体、又拒绝成为机器的时刻。
