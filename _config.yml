# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Alexander Wu is a composer, pianist, electronic producer, improviser, and programmer based in Baltimore, MD. His artistic endeavors delve into the intricate relationships within sound, exploring the interplay between sound and society, as well as the connections among those who create it. His work often draws inspiration from noise, the physicality of sound, and the translation between mediums, languages, and cultures.
