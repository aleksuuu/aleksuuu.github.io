## Long Bio

Alexander Wu is a composer, improviser, pianist, electronic producer, and programmer based in Baltimore, MD. He is interested in far-fetched logic, misplaced memories, profaned tools, and sometimes disappointing sounds. He likes to mechanize the body and embody the machine, just as much as he likes to mechanize the machine and embody the body. Above all, however, he likes when both refuse to be either.

Alexander frequently performs [improvised](https://aleksuuu.github.io/sounds/categories/improvised) music with homemade electronics in DIY venues, museum spaces, and concert halls. He is also a pianist of two decades, proficient in both classical and jazz idioms. As a programmer, he is well-versed in general-purpose languages such as C, C#, Python, Swift, and JavaScript, as well as languages designed for music and multimedia, including Max/MSP/Jitter/Gen, SuperCollider, and TouchDesigner. Recently, he has built a custom live coding environment within Microsoft Excel as part of his ongoing series [Planning Obsolescence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v53BP83Ujqw), which reappropriates productivity tools for musical instruments. Other notable programming projects include [Microtonal Lab](https://aleksuuu.github.io/microtonal-lab/), a website offering microtonal ear training and composition tools; and [VariTuner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCE7SogPt0U), a microtonal tuner and tone generator app for iOS devices, featuring a built-in library of over 5000 microtonal scales.
