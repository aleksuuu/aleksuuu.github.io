## Long Bio

Alexander Wu is a composer, pianist, electronic producer, and improviser based in Boston. His music explores the relationships that exist within sound, between sound and society, and among those who make sound. He has composed in and between various styles, including contemporary classical, jazz, and electronic music. His work is often inspired by noise, the physicality of sound, and the intervening space created through the translation of a medium, language, or culture. 

Alexander graduated from Berklee College of Music with a Bachelor of Music degree in both Composition and Electronic Production and Design as well as a minor in creative coding in 2023. At Berklee, he received the Jeronimas Kaƒçinskas Composition Award, Earle Brown Composition Award, Max Matthews Computer Music Award, Millican Endowed Scholarship, and the Performance Division Piano Award. He has taken masterclasses with esteemed composers such as Alexandra du Bois, Evan Johnson, Julia Wolfe, and Chen Yi, and received readings and recordings from SPLICE Ensemble, Mivos Quartet, loadbang, unassisted fold, cellist Ariel Barnes. His composition mentors at Berklee include Beth Denisch, Gabriele Vanoni, and Marti Epstein.

Since September 2021, Alexander has served as President of Society of Composers at Berklee, a student-led group dedicated to fostering a community for composers to learn and grow from each other. So far, he has helped produce five concerts featuring student composers and performers and conducted a number of interviews with guest composers. 

Alexander was born in 2000 and grew up in Lishui, China. In his spare time, he enjoys reading and making software, beats, and food.
