# Alexander Wu’s Portfolio for DXARTS

## 1. *disturbingly lively, frighteningly inert* (2025)

for flute, bass clarinet, violin, cello, percussion, piano, and electronics

performed by Brightwork Ensemble

8′30″

### <a href="https://aleksuuu.github.io/assets/pdfs/Wu-disturbingly-concert.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>score</strong></a> (if time is limited, look at mm. 19–37 [1:20–2:29] and mm. 75–end [5:20–8:34])

In her seminal work “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1985), Donna Haraway writes of the increasingly ambiguous difference between organism and machine, “Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.” Forty years after its publication, Haraway’s observation has almost become banal. The cyborg is now taken for granted, and we are so irrevocably fused with our machines that we cannot tell our bodies apart from them. Everything is at once disturbingly lively and frighteningly inert, but we still find it difficult to embrace partial, fluid identities, and to dream of kinship between boundaries. In this piece, neither the human performers nor the crushed cans (which act as speakers) hanging in front of them dominate. Instead, each part stubbornly speaks imperfect translations of other parts, reveling in contradictions, false memories, and the strange union of six humans and two crushed cans.

## 2. *Planning Obsolescence #1: Excel* (2025)

Microsoft Excel, Python, Max/MSP

16′54″

### (if time is limited, start at 4:00)

*Planning Obsolescence #1: Excel* is a musical live-coding system in Microsoft Excel. Three sheets in the Excel file provide interfaces for a mixer, a drone generator, and a sequence generator. Both the drone and sequence generators derive their frequencies from four variable base frequencies. All of the frequencies are related by ratios; therefore, one could specify base frequency 2 to be 5/4 of base frequency 1, for instance, or make a sequence that iterates through [7/4, 9/8, 33/32] of base frequency 3, but there is no way to directly specify a frequency or pitch. In the sequencers sheet, the BPM (each cell represents a beat) of each sequencer can be adjusted, and the velocity, duration, attack, and release of each step can be adjusted as well. A Python script manages the transmission of data from Excel to Max/MSP, where eight sine-wave oscillators generate the sound. The Python script also tracks the current locations of the sequencers and displays them on the screen.

## 3. *self-portrait* (in collaboration with Bianca Quigley) (2024)

CRT TV, camera, servo motors, magnets, cassette players, etc. (see documentation for detail)

### <a href="https://aleksuuu.github.io/assets/pdfs/Wu-self-portrait.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>technical documentation</strong></a>

*self-portrait* is a study of self-destruction. Machine-learning models are increasingly trained on recursively generated data, a cyclical process that could unwittingly corrupt their output. This deterioration mirrors the human condition; computers are simply following in our footsteps.

## 4. Free Improvisation (springless spring reverb, with Maxwell Gong, as one half of mod f) (2025)

custom Max/MSP patch, springless spring reverb, contact mics, transducers, miscellaneous objects

11′13″

I am the person on the left playing electronics. My collaborator, Maxwell Gong, is on shaker and voice.

## 6. Microtonal Lab (2023–)

### <a href="https://aleksuuu.github.io/microtonal-lab/" target="_blank"><strong>link</strong></a>

Microtonal Lab is an ongoing project by Alexander Wu. It can generate microtonal ear-training exercises and offer microtonal composition tools.

## 7. Free Improvisation (voice-to-pulsar) (2025)

custom Max/MSP patch with FluCoMa, monome grid, Midi Fighter Twister, microphone

8′53″

The system is made up of two parts: a pulsar synthesizer and an algorithm that sometimes translates my voice to a set of parameters for the synthesizer.
